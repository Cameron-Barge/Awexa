                                    <p><b>Key pain</b>: Many of today’s busy parents have a hard time managing chores for their kids. </p><p>
                                        With everything going on in their lives, the last thing single and/or working parents want to spend their time on is making sure their kids remember their chores and making sure those chores are completed.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><b>Solution</b>: Using technology, parents can assign and track rewards and chores anywhere, anytime. Plus, their kids can report chores as complete and redeem rewards easily, encouraging them to complete their tasks and update their parents without much supervision
                                    </p>
                                    <p><b>Secret Sauce</b>: Many already turn to technology to automate child management. However, existing solutions require that their kids have a device. This is a problem! On average, parents wait to give their children phones until age 10, but they could have chores as early as age 4.
                                        </p><p><b>Design approach</b>: Multi-platform</p>
                                        <p>Use Amazon Echo as chores hub means the child doesn’t need a phone<br />
                                        Provide web/mobile solutions for parents to manage their children’s tasks/rewards<br />
                                        Provide an app for kids for when they get older to retain users
